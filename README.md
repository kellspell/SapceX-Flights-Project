## This web site retrive date from the SpaceX url website API Server
## and we receive satelite data and is displayed on the website

To be able to read the data into our project it has been used also Axios Library
a very famous library
commands for that :
### npm install axios 

### Before upload 
You need to add to your package.json file homepage element bellow version of your file 
#### "homepage": ".";

For the deployment I've use IPFS - Interplanetary File System simply because its free to use
Using a platfform call Fleek 

### Fleet
